## Overview
The Habit Tracker Web Application is designed to help users build and maintain positive habits by tracking daily activities, monitoring progress, and staying motivated.

- **Progress Tracking**: Visualize weekly and monthly progress with real-time updates.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Reminders**: Stay consistent with habit reminders.
- **Data Privacy**: User data is securely stored using Firebase Firestore.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Firebase (No traditional backend server)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
